# NeoQuantum Software Labs â€” Portal

Minimal Angular app with a Coming Soon landing page, subtle animations, and a dynamic favicon.

## Scripts
- Start dev server: `npm run start` (http://localhost:4200)
- Build: `npm run build`
- Test: `npm run test`

## Notes
- Built with Angular 20 (standalone component).
- The landing page lives in `src/app/app.html` and styles in `src/app/app.scss`.
- A small canvas routine sets the favicon at runtime in `src/app/app.ts`.
